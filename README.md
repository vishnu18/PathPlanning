# PathPlanning
Path Planning for Drone using DFS Algorithm
This project is done as part of Theory of Computability. Using tesseract server,
source of the path is identified. A graph is formed using all the nodes and edges
based on the knowledge provided by the user. Depth First Search Algorithm is used
to guide the drone from source to destination using the information provided by the
Graph.
